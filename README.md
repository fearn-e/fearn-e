Hi there! I'm Elowyn (Ellie for short), and alongside making music, I work on various coding projects ðŸ™‚

Currently finishing up my research with the ACorEx project, and will be looking to enter the industry.

## Projects
- [ACorEx](https://github.com/fearn-e/acorex) - audio corpus explorer built with the intention to investigate a 3D UI and time series analysis (2024) [C++]
- Syllabeat - whole keyboard based rhythm game prototype utilising OpenGL built entirely in Max (i.e. a terrible idea) (2023) [Max]
- FearneSynth - polyphonic additive synthesizer with built-in delay (2023) [C++]
- BinByBin FFT - audio processor with individual FFT bin amplitude and phase controls (2023) [Max]
- FMMultiMatrix - frequency modulation synthesizer with 8 oscillators which can be routed into each other (2022) [Max]
- MicroMono - monophonic synthesizer with support for microtonal tuning systems (2021) [Max]
