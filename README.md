Hi there! I'm Elowyn (Ellie for short), and alongside making music, I work on various coding projects ðŸ™‚

Currently finishing up my research with the ACorEx project, and will be looking to enter the industry.

## Projects
[ACorEx](https://github.com/fearn-e/acorex) - audio corpus explorer built with the intention to investigate a 3D UI and time series analysis (2023-present)

Syllabeat - whole keyboard based rhythm game prototype utilising OpenGL built entirely in Max (2022-2023)

FearneSynth - polyphonic additive synthesizer with built-in delay (2022-2023)

MicroMono - monophonic synthesizer with support for microtonal tuning systems (2021-2022)
